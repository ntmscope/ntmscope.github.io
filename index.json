Especially, patients with predisposing lung conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, are the ones most at risk. It has also been involved in nosocomial transmission during surgical procedures. However, the existence of so-called dominant circulating clones that exist globally and are associated with higher mortality and morbidity have lead to the assumption that inter-human transmission (direct or via fomites) takes place in these NTM. It has been stipulated that this NTM undergoes similar evolutional changes as M. tuberculosis complex before becoming a exclusively pathogenic mycobacterium. Objectives: Investigation of the genomic landscape of M. abscessus in Germany, especially among CF-patients and the search for the dominant circulating clones in a German collective. Methods: Clinical and epidemiological data-analysis, whole genome sequencing, genotypic drug susceptibility testing.\nStatus: Data analysis completed, manuscript under review European Nucleotide Archive\nMicroreact project \n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"74ce8ab9af59a9e2a847760e5a5bf16d","permalink":"http://ntmscope.org/project/mab/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mab/","section":"project","summary":"Investigation of the molecular epidemiology of *M. abscessus* in German CF and non-CF patients.","tags":["NTM","M. abscessus","Mycobacterium abscessus","RGM","rapid growing mycobacteria"],"title":"MOMA_CF","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction: M. avium complex is the predominant slow-growing mycobacterium in Europe and North America and consists – among others – of the species M. avium, M. intracellulare and M. chimaera. The latter has been involved in a global outbreak of infections in patients that underwent cardiosurgical interventions. Here, contaminated heater-cooler machines could be identified as point infection source. All three species are present in the environment and have been isolated from water sources in patients homes. However, human-to-human transmission has not been established so far. In CF-patients, M. avium complex is the NTM second most frequently isolated in Europe. If there are dominant circulating clones, as has been described in M. abscessus, remains unclear until now.\n\nObjectives: Investigation of the genomic epidemiology of M. avium complex in multiple centers in Germany.
